# üé¨ Movie Review Sentiment Analysis Web App

An end-to-end machine learning project that classifies movie reviews as either **positive** or **negative**. This project uses a Logistic Regression model trained on the IMDB 50K Movie Reviews dataset and is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Data Cleaning:** A robust pipeline to clean and preprocess raw text data by removing HTML tags, punctuation, and stop words.
* **Feature Engineering:** Utilizes TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text into meaningful numerical vectors for the model.
* **ML Model:** A Logistic Regression classifier trained and evaluated for high accuracy and performance.
* **Interactive UI:** A user-friendly web app built with Streamlit that allows users to enter any movie review and get a real-time sentiment prediction.
* **Modular Code:** The project is cleanly structured into separate Python scripts for each stage of the ML lifecycle: data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and deployment.
